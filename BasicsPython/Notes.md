## What is List Comprehension?

List comprehension is a **syntactic shortcut** in Python that lets you create new lists from existing iterables like **lists, tuples, ranges, or strings**, in a **single, readable line of code** — often replacing the need for loops.  
It can also include conditional logic for filtering.

## Syntax

```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]

```
* expression – the operation or value to include in the new list

* item – variable that *takes each value from the iterable

* iterable – the source of elements (like a list, tuple, range, or string)

* condition (optional) – filter elements based on a test
